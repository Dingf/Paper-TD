READEME - SCRIPTS
--------------------------------------------
*Although not required, it is recommended that
you terminate all of your commands with a
semicolon (;), which signals the end of a command.

*If a command returns false inside of a script,
the rest of the script will NOT be activated.

*For the reason above, it is not possible to
have more than one trigger per script. In addition,
trigger scripts should be placed at the very
end of a script. Any code that comes after will
be ignored, as triggers always return false
when executed.
