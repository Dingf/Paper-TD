Mechanics:
---------------------------------------------
*Splash damage - All splash damage is linear.
For example, a creep that is 16px away from a
projectile that deals splash damage in 32px
will suffer 50% of the damage. One that is 8px
away will suffer 75%, and so on. 

*Inherent splash - All projectiles, even those
with a displayed splash radius of "0px" have
some splash radius to ensure that projectiles
targeting non-existant creeps have a chance to
still hit other creeps. This inherent splash
radius is based on the projectile's size, as
displayed by the sprite. A projectile with a
sprite 16x16px will have an inherent splash
radius of 8 * sqrt(2), equal to the radius of
the bounding circle.
